By 1800 Jay had acquired, by inheritance and by purchase, 750 acres of property near Bedford, New York. In 1799 he began construction of a comfortable 24-room farmhouse. He moved there in 1801, after his retirement from politics. Tragically, Jay's wife Sarah died only months after moving to their new home. John Jay never remarried and lived as a gentleman farmer until his death in 1829. His son William (1789-1858) inherited the house and farm; he later became a leading figure in the struggle to end slavery. William's son John Jay II (1817-1894) inherited the property and upon his death it was given to his son Colonel William Jay (1841-1915).

The Revolution would cause this Loyalist family to eventually flee to Canada, and the Johnson Hall property and most of its contents were subsequently sold at auction following the War.

Sitting atop a grassy hill overlooking the Hudson River and the Catskill Mountains, their house is a fine example of a great estate built by America's financial and industrial leaders during the Gilded Age (1876 - 1917). Also known as the American Renaissance, this period in American history was marked by America's rapid economic growth and emergence as a world power. Darius Ogden Mills, father of Ogden Mills, established the family fortune by investing in banks, railroads and mines. Ogden Mills, like his father, was a noted financier and philanthropist. In 1882 he married Ruth Livingston, whose family had been prominent landowners in the Hudson Valley since the 17th century. In 1890, Ruth Livingston Mills inherited her childhood home and property which had once belonged to her great-grandfather, Morgan Lewis, the third governor of New York State. \n\n\nIn the 1890s Mr. & Mrs. Mills commissioned the prestigious New York City architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White to remodel and enlarge their home. Work began in 1895 and when completed in 1896, the house had been transformed from a 25-room Greek Revival style home into a Beaux-Arts mansion of 65 rooms and 14 bathrooms. Although the interior was lavishly decorated, mostly in the styles of 17th and 18th-century France, many architectural features of the earlier Livingston home such as the all the trims, moldings and many of the fireplaces had been preserved. This melding of grandeur and heritage is characteristic of the American Renaissance period. Owning five homes, the Mills family resided in their Staatsburg home primarily in the fall and entertained as many as 80 guests at a time.

Prominent among the signatures was that of Frederick Philipse III, Lord of the vast Manor of Philipsburg and resident of the elegant mansion known today as Philipse Manor Hall. Frederick Philipse III and his family lived in luxury, well supported by rents from the many tenant farms on his property. Times were changing, however, and while others rebelled against Great Britain, Frederick III defended the Crown. His Loyalist beliefs were so strong that General George Washington ordered him arrested in 1776. Philipse and his family later fled to British occupied New York City and then to England, where the last \"Lord of the Manor\", broken in spirit and health, died in 1786. His land and his mansion were confiscated by the New York State Legislature and sold at public auction.\n\nIn 1868, after passing through the hands of many owners, the house became Yonkers Village Hall and, in 1872, the first City Hall.

There he learned the rhythms of nature and the connections between all living things, lessons that shaped his career as a literary naturalist.\n\nMuch of his adult life was spent on a small farm overlooking the Hudson River in West Park, Ulster County where he grew grapes, and celery while perfecting the art of the nature essay. His work appeared in Harper's, Scribner's, Atlantic Monthly and other magazines of the day, opening the eyes of his 19th- and 20th-century contemporaries to the wonders of the natural world right outside their doors.\n\nHis essays were collected in books that sold more than a million and a half copies in his lifetime and were required reading in schools across the country. He became a respected friend of such luminaries as novelist Hamlin Garland and Ida Tarbell, industrialists Henry Ford, Harvey Firestone and Thomas Edison; and political leaders including Teddy Roosevelt, who wrote of Burroughs, \"It is a good thing for our people that you should have lived.\"\n\nIn 1899 he served as the historian on the Harriman Expedition exploring the coast of Alaska with conservationist John Muir, painter Louis Agassiz, photographer Edward Curtis and a host of scientists.\n\nBut always his heart remained in the Catskills. \"Those hills comfort me as no other place in the world,\" he wrote. And so, in 1910, Burroughs returned to the comfort of the family farm to spend summers in a little farmhouse he named Woodchuck Lodge. There he continued to write in a hay barn up the road, and there he entertained neighbors and luminaries alike.\n\nWhile he was not a strict conservationist or an environmental activist, his message of land stewardship and his quiet warnings about the potential impact of unchecked development and resource consumption resonate today.\n\nJohn Burroughs died March 29, 1921. He was buried on his 84th birthday in what is now Burroughs Memorial Field, a state historic site just up the road from Woodchuck Lodge and within a mile of the farmstead where he was raised.\n\nWoodchuck Lodge, is open for tours the first weekend of each month, May through October, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Memorial Field, where an outdoor exhibit offers photos and information about the life and work of John Burroughs, is open to visitors during daylight hours daily.", image_url: "http://www.cnyhiking.com/NYSP-JohnBurroughsMemorial0792.JPG", address: "1067 Burroughs Memorial Rd.\nRoxbury, NY 12474", phone: "(518) 827-6111", alt_image_url: "http://www.cnyhiking.com/NYSP-JohnBurroughsMemorial0789.JPG"},

The defending American Patriots, outnumbered 3 to 1, fought desperately until driven out of their forts at the points of the enemy bayonets. More than half of the Patriot forces were killed, wounded or captured.\n\nVisitors can learn about this important military post at the site's museum, which showcases original artifacts and weapons, large scale models of the fort and the attack, highly detailed mannequins frozen in poses of battle, and an action packed fifteen minute movie of the 1777 assault. Archeologists have revealed many of Fort Montgomery's remains, including stone foundations of barracks, the gunpowder magazine and eroded redoubt walls.

Many Americans know the song \"John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave,\" but most do not associate the words with this simple farm at North Elba, New York.\n\nOn the night of October 16, 1859, Brown and his followers assaulted the U.S. Arsenal at Harper's Ferry, planning to use the captured arms in an extensive campaign for the liberation of the slaves in the South. Brown was captured on October 18, 1859, imprisoned at Charlestown, Virginia, tried by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and hanged on December 2, 1859. His body was returned to North Elba and was buried in front of his home on December 8, 1859. The remains of several of Brown's followers, who fought and died at Harper's Ferry, were moved to this small graveyard in 1899.\n\nBrown's final prophesy--\"I, John Brown, am quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done,\"--was soon to be realized in the Civil War.", image_url: "https://parks.ny.gov/PhotoGallery/Libraries/John%20Brown%20Farm%20State%20Historic%20Site/images/medium/John_Brown_Farm__8240b.jpg", address: "115 John Brown Road\nLake Placid, NY 12946", phone: "(518) 523-3900", alt_image_url: "https://parks.ny.gov/PhotoGallery/Libraries/John%20Brown%20Farm%20State%20Historic%20Site/images/medium/john_brown_farm_historic.jpg"},

Long before the American Revolution these colonial powers both laid claim to the Champlain Valley and this strategically important peninsula known as Crown Point. The French built Fort St. Frederic here between 1734 and 1737 and used it as a base for raids on British settlements in New York and New England. As a result, the British mounted various expeditions to take control of Crown Point, and in 1759 they were finally successful. They immediately began construction of new fortifications that they called \"His Majesty's Fort of Crown Point\". Enclosing over seven acres this was one of the largest built by the British in North America.\n\nIn 1775, at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the American colonists captured the fort and secured sorely needed cannons and heavy ordnance. Crown Point was occupied by General John Burgoyne's army in 1777 after the American evacuation to Mount Independence and remained under British control until the end of the war. The ruins of Fort St. Frederic, \"His Majesty's Fort of Crown Point,\" and surrounding lands were acquired by the State of New York in 1910.\n\nToday, visitors can explore the preserved ruins of these forts and tour the museum which includes a multimedia orientation program, large scale models, and an exhibit of original artifacts recovered from the site by archaeologists. Additionally, the site offers access to the historic Crown Point Pier, the Champlain Memorial Lighthouse, the walking paths on either side of the newly constructed Lake Champlain Bridge, and fantastic views of Lake Champlain.

The Hall of Honor is located here to commemorate the awarding of the Purple Heart to 137 local World War I veterans on these grounds in 1932. The Purple Heart is awarded only to those who have been killed or wounded by enemy action and is America's oldest military decoration.\n\nThe Hall of Honor is the first in the nation dedicated to commemorating the sacrifices of the more than 1.8 million recipients of this award. The mission of the Hall of Honor is to collect, preserve and share the stories of Purple Heart recipients from all branches of service and across all conflicts for which the award has been available. One way their history and stories are preserved is through the Roll of Honor, an electronic database where visitors can search for Purple Heart recipients, or view a changing selection of Featured Recipients.\n\nAs there is no comprehensive list of Purple Heart recipients in existence, the Roll of Honor here is an effort to develop as comprehensive a list as possible. Enrollments are voluntary, and come from recipients, their families or friends. Visitors who are recipients, or who know of recipients are encouraged to enroll in the Roll of Honor. Information on enrollment can be obtained by contacting the Hall.\n\nThe Roll consists of approximately 10% of the estimated total number of awards. However, it has considerable depth and breadth, representing all fifty states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa and the Philippines. The Roll of Honor also contains the names of recipients who have served from the Civil War to today.\n\nThe gallery exhibits begin by taking visitors through a visual timeline of America's 20th and 21st century conflicts. There is a Timeline Interactive touchscreen which provides information on conflicts from the Civil War through Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan), which represents the range of conflicts for which the Purple Heart has been available.\n\nThe Main gallery exhibits provide visitors with a more personal history of the Purple Heart through artifacts and in the words of the recipients themselves. These stories are told in graphic panels as well as through audiovisual presentations.", image_url: "https://parks.ny.gov/PhotoGallery/Libraries/National%20Purple%20Heart%20Hall%20of%20Honor/images/medium/HALL_OF_HONOR.jpg", address: "374 Temple Hill Road Route 300\nNew Windsor, NY 12584", phone: "(845) 561-1765", alt_image_url: "https://parks.ny.gov/PhotoGallery/Libraries/National%20Purple%20Heart%20Hall%20of%20Honor/images/medium/SCULPTURE.jpg"},

This is where Brigadier General Anthony Wayne led his corps of Continental Light Infantry in a daring midnight attack on the British, seizing the site's fortifications and taking the soldiers and camp followers at the British garrison as prisoners on July 16, 1779.\n\nBy May 1779 the war had been raging for four years and both sides were eager for a conclusion. Sir Henry Clinton, Commander-In-Chief of the British forces in America, attempted to coerce General George Washington into one decisive battle to control the Hudson River. As part of his strategy, Clinton fortified Stony Point. Washington devised a plan for Wayne to lead an attack on the garrison. Armed with bayonets only, the infantry captured the fort in short order, ending British control of the river.\n\nThe Stony Point Lighthouse, built in 1826, is the oldest lighthouse on the Hudson River. De-commissioned in 1925, it now stands as a historical reminder of the importance of lighthouses to commerce on the Hudson River. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 unleashed a surge of commercial navigation along the Hudson River, by linking New York city to America's heartland. Within a year, the first of the Hudson's fourteen lights shone at Stony Point and others soon followed, designed to safely guide maritime travel along the river. Many light keepers, including several remarkable women such as Nancy and Melinda Rose at Stony Point, made their homes in the lighthouse complexes, and ensured that these important navigational signals never failed to shine.\n\nThe site features a museum, which offers exhibits on the battle and the Stony Point Lighthouse, as well as interpretive programs, such as reenactments highlighting 18th century military life, cannon and musket firings, cooking demonstrations, and children's activities and blacksmith demonstrations.", image_url: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Stony_Point_Battlefield_State_Park_-_grassy_ruins.jpg", address: "44 Battlefield Rd.\nStony Point, NY 10980", phone: "(845) 786-2521", alt_image_url: "https://paththroughhistory.iloveny.com/includes/content/images/listings/Stony-Point-Battlefield-State-Historic-Site---Photo-Courteys-of-Palisades-Parks-Conservancy-.jpg"},
